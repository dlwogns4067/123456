      <h2>Malicious Mutations: Researchers created a new deep learning framework called ExPecto to predict the effect of genetic mutations across different tissue systems in the human body. The chart above shows the results for the expression of immunity-related GTPase family M (IRGM), a gene involved in the immune response associated with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and general inflammatory bowel disease. A subset of possible mutations is listed horizontally while tissue systems are listed vertically. Red indicates mutations that ExPecto predicts signal an increase in the expression of IRGM in a given system, while blue represents an expected decrease in expression. </h2>
